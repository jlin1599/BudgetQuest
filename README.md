Budget Quest (Prototype)
========================

A lightweight, front-end-only demo of the Budget Quest idea: budgeting as an RPG.

Included
--------
- Avatar with level + XP bar, simple cosmetic purchase (hat)
- Budget inputs with progress bar and rewards for staying under budget
- Quests (savings goals) with progress, completion badge, and rewards
- Weekly streak tracker with daily log and weekly bonus
- LocalStorage persistence (no backend)
- Mini bar chart of Budget vs Spent using Chart.js CDN

How to run
----------
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or serve locally).
2. Set a budget and expenses; add a quest and increment progress; log daily to build a streak.
3. Earn XP and coins; buy the avatar hat when you reach 20 coins.

Notes
-----
- This is intentionally small for midterm feedback. It demonstrates mechanics and UI without a server.
- Code is vanilla HTML/CSS/JS; a later iteration can migrate to React + Node + MongoDB.
